                <p>To help us pick, pack and dispatch the correct products we need your help.Every product in our warehouse has a barcode. If the product doesnâ€™t have one when you ship it to one of our warehouses, then we will add a barcode to the product packaging.This barcode is what we scan to confirm we have the correct product your customer has ordered.</p>
                <p>To help us with this process we need you to ensure that every product you have in your store has a Barcode value defined that matches the barcode on the product. The barcode must be unique per product, including variants.We are unable to receive a product into our warehouse that you have not defined its barcode value.</p>
                <p>Thanks for your assistance in helping us, ship your products perfectly every time.
                    to the left of this text, please take a screen shot of the barcode input section of the product page in shopify.</p>
